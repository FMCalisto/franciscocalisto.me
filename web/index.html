								In spite of being a new area comparatively to other more traditional engineering branches, information systems and computer engineering has been growing quickly. One of the reasons is the concentration of economic resources on the activities related with information technologies and telecommunications. The curricular evolution of the Information Systems and Computer Engineering taught at the IST has gone along with the technological evolution, which is materialized in the permanent update of curricula, consistently with the practice of other great international engineering Schools. The sound basic fundamentals offered by the IST in information systems and computer engineering ensure that the professionals trained in this area will be prepared to adapt themselves to the permanent technological changes throughout their professional life. The chief objective of the Degree in Engineering Sciences - Information Systems and Computer Engineering (LEIC), taught both at the Taguspark and Alameda campuses, is to offer students thorough knowledge in the area of Engineering, encouraging students' mobility, both to other national and international schools, and probably to the labour market, which still seeks this type of professionals. Given the course duration, the training offered will be solid but limited in terms of the technical autonomy and the technological knowledge provided.

						You're born without them, spend a lifetime acquiring them, and check them at the door on your way out — and for what? To survive in the wild? To get rich and retire early? No. You acquire skills so you can be a man of action, because in a world in which everyone outsources and delegates, action is what sets you apart.
